Technologies:

JavaScript and JavaScript libraries, such as jQuery and Vue JS AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript and XML) to communicate directly with web services from a web page JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) RESTful (Representational State Transfer) APIs (Application Program Interfaces) to standardize the messages used to get JSON objects with AJAX calls
